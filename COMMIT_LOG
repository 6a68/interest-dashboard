Feature:
  Instrumentation of nytimes usage and clicks on recommended areas

30000 feet view:
  - We decided to implement this feature by collecting nytimes visits from places.
  - Each visit will carry timestamp, visitId and fromVisitId in addition to already existent fields
  - Then addon will collect such visits into an array
  - This array will be placed in storage, flushed by Collector to the backend, and then cleaned
  - Since the triple (timestamp, visitId, fromVisitId) uniquely identifies each visit, the analytics
    can always replace corresponding rows into a database table, he

  The collection will happen in HistoryReader:
  - An instance  of a HistoryVisitor is passed to the HistoryReader
  - HistoryReader presents visit information to the Visitor
  - A subclass NYTimesHistoryVisitor will accumulate nytimes visits info into storage
  - Dispatcher sends NYTimesHistoryVisitor storage to backend and cleans the storage
