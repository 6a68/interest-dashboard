<h3>Below you'll see a list of interests and whether Firefox thinks you've
matched that interest in the past 14, 28, or more days. This data is currently
for your education only and is not shared with anyone, including Mozilla. To
stop interest calculations, disable this "User Profile" add-on.</h3>
