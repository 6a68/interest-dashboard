            <div class="content">
                <p>Firefox is conducting a study of personalized content on the Web, and as a Test Pilot user, we’d really appreciate your help in completing this quick study.</p>

                <h2>Contents of the study</h2>
                <p>Mozilla is researching the potential for Firefox to help users experience a more personalized Web.</p>
                <p>The study consists of two components:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Topic Matching (automatically completed in background)</li>
                    <li>User Survey (14 questions, 3 minutes to complete)</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>How it works</h2>
                <p>Firefox will choose a set of interest topics that best match the websites in your browsing history. You will then be asked to answer some questions about those topics and your browsing preferences.</p>

                <p>After completion or 2 months (whichever comes first), the study add-on will remove itself.</p>


                <h2>Data collection</h2>

                <p>Our study is both qualitative as well as quantitive. As such, we will ask you a few questions in a survey, but will also collect some data from your browser for later studies.</p>

                <p>What will be transmitted are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your survey responses</li>
                    <li>The interest topics and match strengths</li>
                </ul>

                <p>No specific websites or browsing history will be sent, and no personally identifying information is collected or sent to Mozilla.</p>
